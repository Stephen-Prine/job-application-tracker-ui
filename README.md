# Job-Application-Tracker-ui Application 
Provides a form for entries of Companies that I've applied for. Keeps track of Company Name, date applied, a link to either the job posting/ company website, and some key notes. It then adds them to my MySQL database and displays a list of all the entries. I know there's going to unfortunately be a lot of entries ;[

## This is the Front End Portion for Job-Application-Tracker 
  This was the Front End User Interface portion of the Application using React Create App 
  * Used TailwindCSS as the CSS framework 
  * Used Components and Classes to build a dynamic UI and Axios to call the rest API and fetch data. 
 
 ## Why Did I build this project. 
I felt the need to keep a record of my job search journey for two main reasons: 
* Have a clear overview of all the companies I've applied to 
* To maintain notes on what each company was looking for or not looking for in a candidate
* I needed a project to work on while learning React. So I thought of this idea as I was putting job posting information in a notepad.
