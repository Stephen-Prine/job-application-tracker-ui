# Job-Application-Tracker-ui Application 
Provides a form for entries of Companies that I've applied for. Keeps track of Company Name, date applied, a link to either the job posting/ company website, and some key notes. It then adds them to my MySQL database and displays a list of all the entries. I know there's going to unfortunately be a lot of entries ;[

## This is the Front End Portion for Job-Application-Tracker 
  This was the Front End User Interface portion of the Application using React Create App 
  * Used TailwindCSS as the CSS framework 
  * Used Components and Classes to build a dynamic UI and Axios to call the rest API and fetch data. 
 
 ## Why Did I build this project. 
I felt the need to keep a record of my job search journey for two main reasons: 
* Have a clear overview of all the companies I've applied to 
* To maintain notes on what each company was looking for or not looking for in a candidate
* I needed a project to work on while learning React. So I thought of this idea as I was putting job posting information in a notepad.

## Just a funny little bonus 
I connected the app to a Random Joke API endpoint to keep me motivated and to add to my absurd joke repertoire. 

## This is still a work in progress 
The current functionality of the app is mostly aligned with the intended purpose. However, there are certain elements that still need to be added. I am planning to include a separate tab within the Job Postings section of the navigation bar. This tab will lead to a new page containing links to various job postings or a centralized hub for top hiring services like Indeed and LinkedIn etc.
